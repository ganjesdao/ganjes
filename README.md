Ganjes DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization focused on [briefly describe the core mission, e.g., "empowering community-driven governance in Web3 through transparent smart contracts and collaborative feature building"]. Our public repository hosts the core smart contracts and Web3 codebase, designed for full transparency, independent audits, and democratic participation. Whether you're a core contributor, investor, or community member, this space enables you to verify systems, raise pull requests (PRs), and engage in pre-launch readiness activities.

We're actively in pre-launch mode and invite you to join conversations, run audits, and provide discerning feedback to shape our roadmap. Non-technical users can learn how to verify transactions, while tech-savvy participants can dive into the code for continuous assessment.

## Features

- **Transparent Smart Contracts**: Fully auditable Solidity contracts for DAO governance, token management, and [list key features, e.g., "voting mechanisms"].
- **Web3 Integration**: Frontend and backend tools built with React and [other tech, e.g., "ethers.js"] for seamless blockchain interactions.
- **Democratic Feature Building**: Open PRs welcome for community-proposed enhancements.
- **Audit-Friendly Structure**: Dedicated directory for reports and vulnerability scans.
- **Verification Tools**: Guides for non-tech users to confirm on-chain transactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- [Other tools, e.g., "Hardhat or Foundry for contract development"]
- MetaMask or compatible wallet for testing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ganjesdao/ganjes.git
   cd ganjes
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your values (e.g., API keys, contract addresses).

### Running the Project

- **Development Mode**:
  ```
  npm start
  ```
  Opens the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

- **Run Tests**:
  ```
  npm test
  ```
  Launches the test runner in watch mode. See [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for details.

- **Build for Production**:
  ```
  npm run build
  ```
  Builds the app into the `build/` folder.

- **Smart Contract Deployment/Testing**:
  - Navigate to the `contracts/` directory.
  - Use Hardhat: `npx hardhat test` or `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`.

For full setup, refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Smart Contracts & Web3 Codebase

Our codebase is fully public to enable independent verification:

- **Key Contracts**: Located in `contracts/`. Core files include:
  - `GanjesDAO.sol`: Governance logic.
  - [List other contracts, e.g., "Token.sol": ERC-20 implementation].

- **Verification Guide**:
  1. **For Tech Users**: Use tools like Etherscan to verify deployed contracts. Run local audits with Slither or Mythril.
  2. **For Non-Tech Investors**: 
     - Connect your wallet to Etherscan.
     - Search for our contract address (e.g., [insert address]).
     - View transactions and read contract state via the "Read Contract" tab—no coding required!
  3. Submit audit reports or scans to the `audits-reports/` directory via PR.

- **Web3 Interactions**: Frontend in `src/` uses [e.g., "ethers.js"] for wallet connections and contract calls. Test on local Ganache or testnets.
